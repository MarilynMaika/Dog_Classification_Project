This project was completed as part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program on Udacity. The goal was to explore image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as "dogs" or "not dogs" and further identify the breed of the dog.

The project involved testing and comparing three CNN architectures:
AlexNet
VGGNet
ResNet
Each model was evaluated on its ability to classify images accurately while balancing accuracy and runtime performance.

Key Results:
VGGNet performed the best with 93.3% accuracy in correctly identifying the breed of dogs.
The models demonstrated the trade-off between accuracy and computation time.
